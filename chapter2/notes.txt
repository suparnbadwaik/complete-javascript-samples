Data types are the basic building blocks of all JavaScript programs.

There are six primitive data types: strings, symbols, numbers, Booleans,
undefined and null.

Non-primitive data types, such as arrays, functions and objects, all have a type
of object.

Variables point to values stored in memory and are declared using the const
or let keywords.

Values are assigned to variables using the = operator.

Strings and numbers have various properties and methods that provide
information about them.

Symbols are unique, immutable values.

Boolean values are either true or false.

There are only seven values that are false in JavaScript and these are known
as falsy values.

Data types can be converted into other data types.

Type coercion is when JavaScript tries to convert a value into another data
type in order to perform an operation.

Logical operators can be used to check if compound statements are true or
false.

Values can be compared to see if they are equal, greater than or less than other
values.
